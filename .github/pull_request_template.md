Submitting a Pull Request:

- Create a fork of this repo in Github
- Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
- Make you change, add tests, and ensure tests pass
- Do not reformat existing code, it makes it hard to see what has changed. Leave the formatting to us.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. If the commit addresses an issue filed in the project, start the first line of the commit with the prefix `GH-` and the issue number in parentheses `(GH-111)`. Then leave a detailed explanation of your change, so a person in the future can understand what your work does.
- Update the `Unreleased` section in the CHANGELOG.md with your change

THANKS!
