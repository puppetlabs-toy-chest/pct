## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- [(GH-285)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/285) Ensure running PCT without arguments does not fail unexpectedly.
- [(GH-287)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/287) Ensure a misconfigured telemetry binary fails early and cleanly.

## [0.5.0]
### Added

- [(GH-222)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/222) Telemetry to the binary, which will report the operating system type and architecture when a command is run; the implementation allows for two binaries: one with telemetry configured and enabled, and one _without_ the telemetry included at all. <!-- For more information, see our [telemetry blog post](link to blog). -->
- [(GH-223)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/223) Added hashed machine uuid generation and included in the telemetry; this will report a universally unique machine ID for each node running PCT and reporting telemetry.
- [(GH-136)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/136) Added `--git-uri` flag to the `pct install` command for installation of templates from remote repositories.

## [0.4.0]

- [(GH-183)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/183) `pct new` handles namespaced templates
- [(GH-184)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/184) `pct install` works against remote `tar.gz` files
- [(GH-185)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/185) `pct build` validates pct-config.yml
- [(GH-167)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdkgo/issues/167) Implement `pct install` CLI command
- [(TEMPLATES-17)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/baker-round/issues/17) Ensure `puppet-content-template` includes the author key in the scaffolded config file
- [(TEMPLATES-18)](https://github.com/puppetlabs/baker-round/issues/18) Ensure all default templates have their author set to `puppetlabs`
